## Instructions

```
cd <directory of the project>
yarn
yarn dev

## Notes

- Project related code is stored under a `src` folder.
  You can use either _relative_ imports or _absolute_ imports (where `src` is the base). An example of importing `BaseLayout` is shown in `index.tsx`

- ESLint will run automatically when saving files.

- Whenever you try to git commit, linting will be run on your staged files.
